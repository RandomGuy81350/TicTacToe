           <h2> <u> Answer to box Question:</u> </h2> <br>
           <p> <b>
                You see there are 3 boxes with the three labels mentioned in question.
                <br> All the labels are placed incorrectly.
                <br> You should choose to pick a fruit from the box with label 'both apples and oranges.'
                <br> <mark> That's because since all the labels are placed incorrectly, this box also has incorrect label, </mark>
                <br> which means it can be one with only apples or only oranges. 
                <br> Now, if you get an apple after picking up a fruit from the box, this box is definitely the one
                <br> with only apples.
                <br>  <mark> Now you are left with two boxes which has label 'only oranges' and 'only apples'. </mark>
                <br> One of them contains only oranges and the other contains both apples and oranges.
                <br> Since all the labels are placed incorrectly, the one with label 'only oranges' does not have only oranges.
                <br> That means <mark>the box with label 'only oranges' has both oranges and apples, and the one with label 
                <br> 'only apples' has only oranges.</mark>
